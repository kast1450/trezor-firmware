# Hardware

Currently, only Trezor T runs Trezor Core. However, we plan to port Core to Trezor One as well ([#24](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/24)).

That being said, Core and Model T are tightly coupled together. That means, Core contains many T-only codebase and documentation.

This section is not concern with Model One whatsoever. Please see the Legacy documentation for that.
